### Roadmap

Since it's my first experience with backend, I know that how I made this plugin is probably wrong, so I plan to learn Express.js and TypeORM, then refactor the code, implement the new features. Here's what I have in mind:

- [ ] Refactor
- [ ] Add more statistic types
  - [ ] Most common products in discarded carts
  - [ ] Top sold products
  - [ ] Top sold product groups (Pair or more)
  - [ ] Most used fulfilment and payment methods
  - [ ] Daily/monthly/yearly sale stats

## Set up Project

### Prerequisites

- Medusa Server (Link to [Quickstart](https://docs.medusajs.com/quickstart/quick-start) here).

### Installation steps

1. Install the plugin:
    ```bash
    npm install medusa-summary-plugin
    ``` 
    or
    ```bash
    yarn add medusa-summary-plugin
    ```
2. Add the plugin to your `medusa-config.js` file:
    ```js
    {
      resolve: `medusa-summary-plugin`
